    <h1>Understanding Your Computer</h1>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Often considered the "brain" of the computer, the CPU handles most calculations which enable your computer to function.</li>
            <!-- Add more points here -->
        </ul>

        <h2>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>RAM is your system's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data that your computer is actively using so that it can be accessed quickly.</li>
            <!-- Add more points here -->
        </ul>

        <h2>Storage (HDD/SSD)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) and SSDs (Solid State Drives) are the primary means of long-term data storage in computers. SSDs are faster but often more expensive per GB than HDDs.</li>
            <!-- Add more points here -->
        </ul>

        <h2>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The GPU is specialized hardware for rendering images and videos. It's particularly important for gaming, video editing, and rendering 3D graphics.</li>
            <!-- Add more points here -->
        </ul>

        <h2>Motherboard</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all the different parts of the computer together, including the CPU, RAM, storage, and GPU.</li>
            <!-- Add more points here -->
        </ul>

        <h2>Power Supply</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This component converts power from your home electricity supply into a form that the computer components can use.</li>
