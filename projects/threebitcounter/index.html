    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <section id="introduction" class="mt-5">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In this project, we explore computing in its purest form. By foregoing the abstractions offered by microchips, integrated 
        circuits and even logic gates, we develop an intuition and appreciation for the simplest building block underpinning
        modern computing - the transistor. Given that modern computers offer millions, sometimes billions of transistors inside a 
        single chip, we will focus our efforts here on a simpler logic device with a much lower transistor count. The 3-bit counter 
        is the perfect candidate. It has, as we will see, a relatively low transistor count, yet still posesses basic logical 
        structures present in the most modern of computers. In this project, we will start with an overview and block diagram of a 
        3-bit counter, explore the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), build and simiulate a digital circuit, and finally design, 
        assemble and test the circuit on a printed circuit board (PCB).</p>

    <!-- THE THREE BIT COUNTER -->
    <section id="the-three-bit-counter" class="mt-5">
      <h2>The 3-bit Counter</h2>
      <p>A 3-bit counter is a simple digital circuit made up of three <em>flip-flop</em> circuits (one per bit) that steps through 
         every binary value from 000 to 111 (0–7 in decimal) and then wraps back around to 000. Each clock pulse advances the count 
         by one, with the least significant bit toggling every pulse and higher bits toggling only when the bit below rolls over. This
         gives a neat, orderly binary sequence, which we will visualise via three LEDs for the binary output, and a seven-segment 
         display for decimal output.

         Most notable are the three D flip-flops (one each for \(S_{0}\), \(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\)), next-state combinational logic 
         blocks and the binary and 7-segment decoder. To drive the decimal output via the 7-segment display, we need a 
         7-segment decoder logic block to drive the necessary LED segments for each input number. Lastly, a clock pulse is provided to the three
         flip-flops to synchronise the system. We will explore how each of these blocks work in the following section.

      <h2>Resistor Transistor Logic - Crossing from Digital to Analog</h2>
      <p>You are probably already familiar with the primitive logic functions, NOT, AND, OR, XOR and their negations. In the simplest case
        these logic functions transform two binary inputs A and B into a binary output, Y, corresponding to the given function. For example,
        Figure 3.1 shows the NAND gate alongside its <em>truth table</em>. The NAND gate is surprisingly versatile and will 
        be of prime importance in the following <a href="#digital-logic-design">digital design section</a>.</p>

      <p>These logic gates are powerful and allow the construction of more complex digital building blocks, 
        eventually all the way to a full CPU. However, how can we build logic gates in the real world? The symbol above is a 'black-box',
        abstracting details away from the actual implementation. Surprisingly, logic gates can be implemented in various ways, for example, water 
        valves, relays, Minecraft redstone and of course, transistors. There are various <em>logic families</em> which use 
        transistor logic. For this project, we have selected resistor–transistor logic (RTL) due to its simplicty, from both an implementation 
        and educational standpoint.</p>
      <p>Resistor–Transistor Logic (RTL) emerged in the early 1960s as one of the first practical digital families built from discrete 
        components. By combining simple resistors for pull-up bias and NPN transistors for pull-down switching, RTL enabled the 
        construction of basic logic. This lead to transistor counts far lower than earlier relay or vacuum-tube 
        systems. Widely used in early computer prototypes and minicomputers, RTL laid the groundwork for more advanced families (DTL, TTL) by 
        demonstrating how discrete components could reliably implement Boolean functions at kilohertz-scale clock rates. Interestingly,
        RTL was used for the guidance computers of the Apollo missions!</p>
      <p>RTL is remarkably simple, the only components required are NPN bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and resistors. In each gate, 
        NPN transistors act as pull-down switches, while resistors provide pull-up bias. It is important that we operate all BJTs in their
        'saturation' mode, where they act like a switch than a current amplifier. We spare the details, but one should appreciate 
        the analog electronics going on here. For logic, we use a 0-5 V voltage scale, with 
        [0-1] V meaning '0' (LOW) and [3-5] V meaning a '1' (HIGH). In general, AND functions are implemented with BJTs in 
        series, and OR functions with BJTs in parallel. In fact, the natural logic formed by these gates is NAND and NOR, respectively. 
        To save on components (additional NOT gates), we restrict ourselves to these three logic functions. (Aside: one can actually show
        that any other logic function can be built purely from NAND gates). After experimentation with noise immunity, rise time and
        (critically) <em>fan-out</em>, 1 kΩ pull-ups were standardised for the collector resistance, whilst 10 kΩ would be used on the  
        gate-inputs to isolate transistor bases and limit drive current. Fan-out refers to the phenomenon where the logical tolerances 
        of a logic gate degrade as it drives an increasing number of inputs. For example, if we connect the output of an RTL NAND gate 
        to the inputs of 6 downstream gates, each will load some base current through the collector resistor of the previous stage. 
        A voltage divider expression was used to derive a function for the loss in ability of driving a logic HIGH as fan-out increased. 
        As 3 V was deemed tolerable to push the BJTs into saturation to pull down to a 'healthy' LOW, a rough fan-out limit of 6-8 was calculated and 
        simulatied in JScircuit. Figure 3.1 shows a 2-input RTL NAND gate simulation in JScircuit. Based on the input switches, one 
        can see that this behaviour is consistent with the NAND gate in Figure 3.1. Note that the output produces a clean 5 V when 
        the inputs are LOW, however this voltage will sag when the output drives a gate downstream. Additionally, the output cannot 
       reach a true 0 V due to the V_CE(sat) of the transistors.</p>

    <!-- DIGITAL LOGIC DESIGN -->
    <section id="digital-logic-design" class="mt-5">
      <h2>Designing Digital Logic Blocks</h2>
      <p>At the heart of the 3-bit counter are three fundamental digital logic blocks: the  D flip-flops that 
        store each bit, the next-state toggle logic that determines when each flip-flop should change state, and the 
        seven-segment decoder network that converts the binary count into signals for the decimal display. Each of these blocks 
        must operate reliably using only discrete RTL components, so we must carefully balance speed, 
        noise immunity, and component count while keeping the entire design simple enough for hand-assembly.</p>
      <h3 class="mt-5">4.1 D Flip‑Flop</h3>
      <p>Flip-flops are the fundamental digital circuit responsible for volatile memory. They are the key to how computers can store 
         data. For this project, we have 3-bit in our counter, which means we mean to store 3 state bits. Each flip-flop can store 1 bit, 
         so we will need 3 of them. The key to computer memory is feedback and the ability to settle into stable states. Whenever feedback 
         is involved, digital circuits will generally be non-combinational - i.e. they possess memory. The D flip-flop is an example of a 
         <em>sequential circuit</em>. In order to construct the D flip-flop, we must first conside the D latch, shown in Figure 4.1.1.</p>

              0 & 1 & Q_{\text{old}} \\

            Figure 4.1.1 — D-latch digital circuit and truth table.
          </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>One may consider each case of the output Q and trace the signals back through the cross-coupled NAND gates to convince oneself of 
      the truth table in Figure 4.1. Effectively, the latch is 'transparent' to the data signal (D) when CLK is HIGH, and 'opaque' when 
      it is LOW. However, imagine the is a glitch in the data signal during the clock HIGH period. In this case, this glitch will be 
      passed to the output Q. This is undesirable. We would like the circuit to <em>sample</em> D instantenously at the 
      <em>rising edge</em> of the clock. Doing so results in the D flip-flop.</p>
      <p>The D flip‑flop (DFF) is implemented as two D-latches, master and slave. On the falling edge of the clock, the master latch closes 
        and the slave latch opens, capturing the input effectively instantenously and securely storing it. In order for this to work on 
        the rising edge of the clock, we must feed the inverse (NOT) of CLK into the slave's clock input. The final D flip-flop is shown, 
        in Figure 4.1.2, using D-latch blocks.</p>

        <figcaption class="text-muted mt-2">Figure 4.1.2 — D flop-flop digital circuit, showing master and slave D-latches.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      Given our RTL implementation, we can easily build 3 DFFs using BJTs and resistors. Next we consider how to drive the data inputs.
      
      <h3 class="mt-5">4.2 Next‑State Logic</h3>
      <p>Now we can store 3-bit numbers, but how do we get the circuit to count? The answer is to design combinational logic blocks 
        which drive the data inputs of the DFFs. Every rising edge of the clock, the <em>state</em> of the counter must update. 
        Thus, our counter is in fact a <em>finite state machine</em> (FSM). There are 8 total states, corresponding to the range of
        a 3-bit number, i.e. the integers 0 (000) through 7 (111). On each rising clock edge, the FSM must transition from state n 
        to state n + 1. This seems easy, however our state is <em>binary encoded</em> with 3 bits. We will call them \(S_0\), \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) from 
        least to most significant. Given this, the decision of when each bit must toggle is non-trivial. In a simple sequential circuit such as a shift-register, this logic is simple - the 
        output bit of one DFF (i.e. \(Q_n\)) simply flows into the input of the next (\(D_{n+1}\)). In this section, we develop the combinational 
        logic blocks required to drive the data inputs of each DFF.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Let us first analyse how binary counting works, from one 3-bit number to the next. See Figure 4.2.1. Looking down the columns for each 
         \(S_n\) we see the \(S_0\) simply toggles on each transition between '0' and '1'. \(S_1\) toggles in a similar way, exceot it toggles on every 2nd 
         transition. Cosistent with this pattern, \(S_2\) toggles on every 4th transition. From this, we can already see that the input for the \(S_0\)
         DFF, i.e. \(S_{0}^{\,n}\) is simply the inverse (NOT) of the output \(Q_1\), or \(S_{0}^{\,n+1}\)! Following the standard sum-of-products (SOP) 
         boolean algebra simplication procedure, we prove this obvious result in Figure 4.2.2. </p>

          </figcaption>
      </figure> 
      <p>Thus, the next-state logic block for the \(S_0\) DFF (\(NSL_0\)) is simply a NOT gate.</p>
      <p>The next-state logic for \(S_1\) is more complex. Let us first consider how this works in the familiar decimal system. When any 
        column in a decimal number, i.e. units, tens, hundreds, etc. reaches '9', the next increment will <em>overflow</em> that column 
        and cause a carry of '1' to be added to the next column. This is simpler in binary as the maximum number in any binary-place is 
        '1'. Thus, glancing back to the state-transition table in Figure 4.1.1, we see that \(S_1\) should only toggle on the next rising-edge 
        if \(S_0\) is currently a '1'. Note that this toggling functionality would make the logic trivial if we were using a
        <em>T flip-flop</em>. Alternatively, following the standard boolean arithmetic SOP procedure, we see that \(S_1\) is only a '1' on 
        the next edge if it is \(S_1 = 0\) AND \(S_0 = 1\), OR if \(S_1 = 1\) AND \(S_0 = 0\). Again, we can see this algebraically in Figure 4.2.3.
        
      <p>Thus, the next-state logic for the \(S_1\) DFF (\(NSL_1\)) is the XOR of \(S_0^{\,n}\) and \(S_{1}^{\,n}\). This simple 
        expression is nice, but recally we can only implement NAND, NOT and NOR with RTL logic. For simplicity, we aim for just NAND 
        and NOT. Hence, we cannot directly implememt the XOR function. To develop a 'NAND-friendly' expression, we need to 'unsimplify' 
        using a special result called <em>De Morgan's Theorem</em>, which states the following</p>
        <figure class="diagram-container text-center my-5">
          <p>
          \[
            \begin{alignedat}{2}
              \overline{A + B} &= \overline{A}\,\overline{B}, 
              &\quad
              \overline{A\,B} &= \overline{A} + \overline{B}
            \end{alignedat}
          \]
          </p>
        </figure>
      <p>In simple words, this theorem states that we may 'push' negations through a logic function (from input to output, or vica versa), so 
        long as we change ORs to ANDs and ANDs to ORs. Now we 'NAND-friendly' simplify \(S_{1}^{\,n+1}\) in Figure 4.2.4.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-5">4.3 7‑Segment Decoder</h3>
      <p>The final combinational logic block converts the 3-bit binary count into segment signals for the LED decimal display. 
         Each of the seven segments corresponds to an LED inside the physical 7-segment display depicted in Figure 4.3.1. Later, we 
        will need to tweak our 7-segment decoder to actually drive the the LEDs inside the common-cathode 7-seg display we will use. 
        For now, a '1' or HIGH output will suffice in our analysis to turn a segment on.</p>

            Figure 4.3.1 — 7-segment digit patterns.
          </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>To gain an intuitive understanding for the logic we must design, let us think about the problem mathematically. Effectively, we are 
      trying to implement a function of 3 variables, to 7 variables - i.e. 3 inputs (\(S_2, S_1, S_0\)), to 7 outputs 
      (\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g\)). Additionally, the input and output variables live inside the <em>binary field</em>, \(\mathbb{F}_2\). This a fancy
      algebraic way of saying our binary variables, like \(S_1\), can only take on the values of '0' and '1', and may be operated on by 
      any of our logical function, NAND, NOT, etc. Mathematically, the 7-segment decoder function, \(f\), is correctly represented with 
      the notation in Figure 4.3.2. The image shows the functional representation of our desired combinational logic function. The 
      remainder of this subsection will investigate the logic inside.</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In order to implement this function, we need to repose the problem as 7 independent functions of the 3 inputs, then analyse the 
      truth table and SOP expression for each. For example \(f_{a}:\;\mathbb{F}_2^3 \;\longrightarrow\;\mathbb{F}_2, \quad (S_2,S_1,S_0)\;
      \mapsto\;a\) represents the single output segment \(a\) as a function of the 3 input bits. We will provide full derivations of 
      the simplifed functions for \(a\) and \(b\), leaving \(c, d, e, f\) and \(g\) as exercises to the reader.</p>
      <p>Firstly, we write out the truth table for the 7-seg decoder function by analysing the digit patterns in Figure 4.3.1.</p>

      <p>Next, we derive and simplify the SOP expressions for \(a\) and \(b\). In this subsection, we will use <em>Karnaugh maps</em> 
      for simplification.</p>
      <p>For segment \(a\), we wish to find minimised SOP expression \(a = f_{a}\left(S_0, S_1, S_2\right)\). As there are less than 
         five variables, we may use a Karnaugh map to find the minimised SOP expression. Karnaugh maps provide an easy graphical way 
         to find minimised boolean expressions for binary functions of 4 or less variables. In the Karnaugh map in Figure 4.3.4, we 
         use Gray code to enumerate the rows and columns, with the ability to pair \(S_0\) and \(S_1\) across the columns. Then, for 
         a minimised SOP expression, we circle all the '1' in as few as possible rectangles, which must contain a power of two '1's. 
         Confusingly, the map must be thought of as <em>toroidal</em> (i.e. a donut) to catch the 'wrap-around' simplifications.
